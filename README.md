## Purpose

- Handle remote authentication

## Requirements

An Udacity account is required to use this app.

## How to use

The app will display locations pinned to a map by yourself and other Udacity students. You can view the data as pins on a map, or use the tab bar to switch to a table view. 

Clicking on a pin, or a table view item, will launch the url associated with that pin in your browser.

You can add your own pins using the `+` in the top right corner. Enter an address and URL you would like to associate with that URL.
